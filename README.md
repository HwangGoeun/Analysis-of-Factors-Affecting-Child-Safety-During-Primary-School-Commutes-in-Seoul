## 📌 Project Description
This project investigates the key environmental and infrastructural factors influencing the commuting safety of elementary school students in Seoul. Using the child traffic accident rate as a safety indicator, the study compares regions with high and low accident occurrences to uncover patterns and correlations. The goal is to propose actionable strategies that can enhance safety during school commutes.

<br>

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Analyze traffic accident data involving children in Seoul
- Identify regions with high and low accident rates
- Examine the influence of infrastructure elements (e.g., crosswalks, school zones, illegal parking) on accident rates
- Recommend policy and urban design improvements based on findings

<br>

## 📍 Study Areas
- **High-accident districts**: Gwanak-gu, Geumcheon-gu  
- **Low-accident districts**: Gangbuk-gu, Dobong-gu

<br>

## 🔍 Key Factors Analyzed
1. **Crosswalk Density**  
   - Number of crosswalks within 700m radius of schools  
   - Excessive density may cause confusion and increase risks

2. **School Zone Coverage**  
   - Number of designated child protection zones per school  
   - More zones generally correlate with lower accident rates

3. **Illegal Parking Incidents**  
   - Number of parking violations within 700m of schools  
   - 40% of pedestrian accidents in school zones are related to illegal parking  
   - Schools near large apartment complexes with proper parking show fewer violations

<br>

## 📈 Results Summary
- Low-accident areas generally:
  - Have **more school zones**  
  - Experience **fewer illegal parking cases**  
  - Show **moderate crosswalk density**

- High-accident areas often:
  - Have **fewer school zones**  
  - Suffer from **frequent illegal parking**  
  - Exhibit **high or poorly planned crosswalk density**

## 🧪 Example Data

| District Type | Crosswalks | School Zones | Illegal Parking Cases |
|---------------|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| High-A        | 56         | 6            | 18,143                 |
| High-B        | 34         | 8            | 10,738                 |
| Low-A         | 39         | 11           | 11,105                 |
| Low-B         | 15         | 11           | 11,673                 |

## 🧩 Conclusions
- **Crosswalk Placement**: Needs to be strategic—neither too sparse nor too dense
- **School Zone Enforcement**: Stronger regulation and speed enforcement reduce accidents
- **Illegal Parking**: Urban planning must consider adequate parking near schools
- **Technology Use**: Future safety improvements can leverage AI, drones, and smart sensors

<br>

## 🛠 Suggested Actions
- Improve driver awareness and compliance with school zone rules  
- Enhance spatial infrastructure for pedestrians  
- Apply smart city technologies for monitoring and enforcement  
- Design city layouts that naturally reduce unsafe behavior (e.g., adequate parking)
